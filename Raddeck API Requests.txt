%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%&&

This is a list of API calls that would help making LP modding easier / better.      

*******************************************************************************
#1

What NickNo asked in nn_API_requests_3.19.txt - PornEmpire mod
https://f95zone.to/threads/lifeplay-v4-6-vinfamy.11321/post-4881047


*******************************************************************************
#2

We have energy for stat.
In real to boost energy, we need to eat.
So sleeping is not suppose to fill up my belly.

I propose to have "Hunger" or something like that

energy for sleeping
hunger for eating

I eat something
hunger += 2


*******************************************************************************
#3

animate(pray)
Not working outside the church

Remove the limitation on "animate()" animations. 
I want to work out in a church, pray in a park, do yoga at home,...


*******************************************************************************
#4

Having a command to do things like:

Eg: If a girl bend down, having the chance to fuck her from behind.
Something to make rape/surprise sex scenes better


*******************************************************************************
#5

Car-motorcycle-bicycle
Having a command to go faster depending with what you used for travel


*******************************************************************************
#6

Can you make an animated background to give the impression of driving a car/motorcycle/bicycle? To make them useful ...

As we have cops
A background showing us in the back/front seat, as policemen (front), as a prisoner (back) - inside a police car.

As we have cars, motorcycle
A background showing us driving a car (from inside the car and outside too)

Be able to do crazy shit like, fucking my wife on motorcycle when riding on train road.


*******************************************************************************
#7

Having new animate() & Filter()
animate(wasted), animate(stoned), animate(drugged), animate(paralyzed)
- Drunk (affects vision and mobility)
- Drugged (affects vision and mobility)
- Paralyzed (cannot move)
- Too wasted to stay straight (for example. when we fuck, Actor can fall from the bed or some positions are not doable because of is state...) (affects mobility and vision)

- Bending
- Be on "four legs"

And also be able to use any sex position separately
A lots are not working on Trans.

*******************************************************************************
#8

.isInterestedIn(Men/Trans/Women())
Mean what? You're almost bi or gay, ....at what level???

We need a value for those variables(), like: 
10 - will never sleep with a guy
50%- Maybe
... 

eg.
.isInterestedInMen(60)
.isInterestedInWomen(100)

*******************************************************************************
#9

Allow the modder to set the business hours
That's an another thing I hate the most, the limitation on the opening hours of stores and other.
Ex: Public toilets close at 6:30pm ---> Useless

Please, remove this useless limitation and let us configure it ourselves (in AI for example).


*******************************************************************************
#10

Solo dildo/fingering ass animation for Female and Male is needed


*******************************************************************************
#11

Suggestion for residential
1- Have the ability to own more than one home and be able to have a rental business.
For example: If the game recognizes the size of buildings
If the building is a house: rent rooms (like the HomeExpander mod)
If the building is a building: rent an apartment


2- Have the ability to own a home for commercial, criminal or other purposes that are not present in LifePlay

*******************************************************************************
#12

In LifePlay main menu (not in game)
1- Add a button to reload the game (to reset stats, achievements,...)
2- When starting a new game, choice to reset or to stay with old stats
3- Add a button for Mods manager

Because right now, when you start a new game, most of the old data is retained.

*******************************************************************************
#13

Having the possibility to create a table: To display paragraphs of text, imitate a letter, etc ... Would be useful for making a tutorial inside our mods.


*******************************************************************************
#14

A way to add popover/tooltips message on menu items in a scene.


*******************************************************************************
#15

Having a new function called "hadSexWith()" to do something like: 
If Player.hadSexWith(Actor69)


*******************************************************************************
#16

A new function called "hadSexWithCreature()"  

Ex: Because if the dog hadSex() with another dog, hadSex() become useless


*******************************************************************************
#17

adding a working door to entrances and rooms connected with other rooms


*******************************************************************************
#18

Be able to use our own variables inside conditions (the header of the files) for lpaction and lpscene files


*******************************************************************************
#19

Allow the modder to take over business on some store/building.
- Like churches and I think bank,community center, university,..., we can't take them over


*******************************************************************************
#20

Replace the categories menu at the top of the actions menu for a horizontal scrolling menu, so modders can add their own category or just adding more categories.


*******************************************************************************
#21

What's the purpose of "Watersports", if:
1: Player/NPC cannot pee (no solo animation)
2: No statistics for this sexual preference
3: Player/NPC doesn't like receiving urine
4: Player/NPC doesn't want to pee because there's no pee level.
5: No pee level based on number of drinks drunk


*******************************************************************************
#22

Having the possibility to add one block of houses (not 2), as decoration, when creating lpworld
The one provided actually contains 2 block of houses and a street in the middle.


*******************************************************************************
#23

Add a variable to be able to remove NPC generated automatically by the game. 

Something like removeAllPersonHere()

Because:
If you want to create a fake room inside a shop or houses
There is no way to remove the NPC's generated by the game. So, you can't be alone in your room....


*******************************************************************************
#24

Do a duplicate of the animation "Shower" and create one called "Caress myself" or something alike.
Without the toilet background


*******************************************************************************
#25

Filter(RubPussy) - Can you add also RubPussyOnFace and RubPussyOnThigh

*******************************************************************************
#26
Since we have isTrans(), please remove trans generation from isMale() and isFemale() that's really annoying.

Set the gender like that, please:
isFemale() = Female only or something female, no trans
!isFemale() = Male only or something male, no trans
isMale() = Male only or something male, no trans
!isMale() = Female only or something female, no trans

isTrans = A trans only - random m/f
isFemale() && isTrans = A female trans only
isMale() && isTrans = A male trans only
OR isTrans(Female).... 

Instead of doing generatePerson
Actor.isFemale() || !Actor.isTrans().... for trying to find the right formula.

Why not just use generatePerson for random NPC

And create new variables for specific genders.
Something like:
generateMale()
generateFemale()
generateMaleTrans()
generateFemaleTrans()
generateHerma()


*******************************************************************************
#27

How can we use the dog races?
DogWhippet
DogDobermann
DogAustralianCattle
DogBulldog
DogDalmatian
DogLabrador

They exist in the game, so, how to use them separately?


*******************************************************************************
#28

When the Player moves to an NPC, vice versa, he should use the shortest path. Instead of going around the room before sitting down.


*******************************************************************************
#29

As we can buy binoculars, having a background showing us looking with. To spy on the neighbours! Will be better!

 

*******************************************************************************
#30

A button to mute the music when we start the game or a way to change it would be even better!


*******************************************************************************
#31

When starting a new game, having the possibility to activate mods before starting the game.


*******************************************************************************
#32

Add an option to the main menu of the game, to open the background (lpworld files) editor without starting a new game.
-...
New game
Save
Background editor
-...


*******************************************************************************
#33

When editing a room with the editor, once finished, it would be cool to have an option to go back to the room I had before editing. 
In addition to the already existing option to save it.


*******************************************************************************
#34

partialUndress(true/false)
So the game can detect if the player has wardrobe items set to "partial undress"


*******************************************************************************
#35

Have a function : setAdoptiveRelativeType(Parent)
Example : Having an asian mother, a black father, while I am white.

*******************************************************************************
#36

Different background when visiting prison  ---> it can be police background
Because it's not possible to set a different background at the moment. Looks like prison background is hardcoded inside imprison()
OR
Simply remove the prison background inside imprison() and let us set the background we wants.


*******************************************************************************
#37

Having a function called "isInSameRoomAsPlayer()" or something alike, to prevent having a phone call from someone in the same room!


*******************************************************************************
#38

getBuildingID() To get the ID of the current building.


*******************************************************************************
#39

Would be great to have animation of hugging without sex: 
Player(Hug)::"..."
animatePair(Player, Actor, Hugging)
Actor(Hug)::"..." 


*******************************************************************************
#40

Shower scenes: Have animations for the player washing the NPC, for the NPC washing the player and also one where the player and the NPC take a shower together while the water is running...


*******************************************************************************
#41

Having a variable called isSleeping(): to know if Player/Actor is really sleeping.


*******************************************************************************
#42

An animation for Kissing only, no touching


*******************************************************************************
#43

Having a variable called isSceneID() to trigger an event when we are on a specific lpscene


*******************************************************************************
#44

Actor.animate(Standing) Because sometimes the NPC/MC talks while he is lying on the floor/bed, while he is at the water machine,....


*******************************************************************************
#45

Have the option of using :
A cucumber, banana, sausage, fish ... as a dildo
An apple pie, a teddy bear, a sofa (slide our dick between the cushions) as a fleshlight.
Some crazy ideas!


*******************************************************************************
#46

A way to call a lpaction without having to click on the action name. ex: followUpAction(mylpactionFile)


*******************************************************************************
#47

When starting a new game, it would be cool to have an option like:
"Start with a family".
If "Start with a family" option is enabled, you start the game with a mom and a dad.


*******************************************************************************
#48

Not really a bug but these locations are missing in the "Locations Menu" + My suggestion if doable
Parks (maybe using one of the smaller green spots on the city map)
Forests (maybe using one of the big green spots on the city map)
Festivals (maybe using one of the smaller green spots on the city map)
Beaches (maybe using one of the big green spots on the city map)
Rivers (maybe using one of the big green spots on the city map)
Mountains (maybe using one of the big green spots on the city map)


*******************************************************************************
#49

Will be cool to be able to create a female with no vagina but with a dick.
Will be cool to be able to create a male with no dick but with a vagina.


*******************************************************************************
#50

Remove "Vore" from random sex position animations, when Vore is not enable. Very annoying!


*******************************************************************************
#51
A way to hide/remove "Inquire about a vacancy"
