PornEmpire (LifePlay) ReadMe, Change Log and TODO List
========================================================

ReadMe
********

Porn Empire is a LifePlay mod (add-on) that allows you to run your own 
porn business in LifePlay. You start at a very low level taking videos 
with your smart phone of your sex workers and your perverted dates.

Over time your business grows and you can buy more equipment and employ 
workers that will assist you in your daily tasks.

LifePlay version 3.17 or later is required for Porn Empire to work correctly!


Earning money in PornEmpire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Money can be earned by launching a website and putting videos and web cams online. 
Videos will be downloaded by your visitors as soon as you release them and 
they will pay money for that.
* If you have famous models you will get more visitors.
* Model fame grows with an increasing download count.
* If you get better equipment you will get more valuable videos.
* The older a video gets the more its value drops.

Money is currently earned by launching the "Check business performance" 
action in the sex work tab.


Getting videos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just launch the action "Organize a shooting" from the sex work tab. 
If you have a companion the companion will be asked to take part in the 
session otherwise you can choose one of your contacts.

If the chosen model is not a sex worker or not perverted enough (more than 55%) 
he/she will decline. Try your luck to convince him/her if his/her masochist stat 
is low enough (less than -50%).

Every model will ask for money. You may try to negotiate as well.
If you are really low on money dates and relatives with a good relationship to you 
(rapport more than 55%) may do it without being paid.

By the way, if you convinced someone to become a model the tag "PEModel" 
will be added to this contact.


Uploading stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you managed to launch your website (action "Launch a porn website" in the 
"Manage business" menu) you can upload previously created videos to it. 

You should do that right after doing some shoots as nobody will be able to see 
your new work if you do not upload it.

A web admin could do that task for you and improve the quality of the uploaded 
content but will cost some money. If you upload stuff it will take your time and 
energy, if you have an admin there will be no time and energy penalty.

Emails and Castings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Randomly you can meet someone who wants to model for you. 
If so, invite them for a casting.

To do the casting read your mails. Even if you did not meet 
someone yet it might be, you get some applications by mail.

The more famous you are the more applications you will get.

Models that are added by castings usually are unknown or real 
amateurs so this is a good but cheap chance to get new models.


Porn fame in PornEmpire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The porn fame of a model affects the amount of money you earn with him/her. 
Videos of famous models keep the interest in them high for a longer time. 

So a shooting with a famous model costs more money, but the results will be 
better and the demand for them will last longer.

Additionally the models attractiveness affects the value of her/his work. 
... and of course the price ;-)

If a models fame changes after doing a shoot this will also affect the 
value of the footage.

The porn fame of a cam operator and scene assistant affects the quality 
(and therefore price) of the shooting results. A famous CamOp' and scene asist
is also more expensive to hire.


Porn genres in PornEmpire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are the following distinct genres in Porn empire: Amateur, Solo, 
Lesbian, Gay, Threesome and Gang Bang / Reverse Gang Bang. 

Your visitors will request all of these genres to be available on your website. 
If you do not satisfy the need you will loose visitors. You should keep at 
least 6 of these 7 genres updated regularly.

How to get these genres? 

 Solo: Have exactly one male or female model do a shooting.
 Gay: Have 1+ male model(s) and no females do a shooting.
 Lesbian: Have 2+ female models do a shooting.
 Threesome: Have 1 male and 2 female or 2 male and 1 female models do a shooting.
 Gang Bang: Have 3 males and 1 female in one shooting.
 Reverse Gang Bang: Have 3 females and 1 male in one shooting.

Amateur requires at least one model of the shooting to have a porn fame 
below 25%. As the fame increases with time (if you uploaded stuff of a model) 
you occasionally have to find new amateurs.

To know what is demanded by your visitors use the 'Manage your business' menu.

To know in which shootings a model did participate use the 'Manage employees' 
menu.

Employees in PornEmpire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are 3 types of employees in PornEmpire:
- Models
- Web cam models
- Regular employees

MODELS 
------

Models don't have contracts with you. 
You book them once, you pay them once.

The model's price depends on fame, intelligence and attractiveness.
The higher these stats are, the more it will cost but it will also perform better.

Porn fame can change later, and will affect previously done shootings.

If you have sex workers ("Offer pimp services") you can ask them to become 
a model as well. They will get a fixed payment and won't be bitchy ;-)

You can ask any contact to be a model, or ask the PornAgency to recruit one - 
or do a casting (by Checking your Mails).

Tag (Contact list): PEModel


WEB CAM MODELS
--------------

Web cam models perform live on web cam. How often, is up to you. 
Contrary to normal models they do have a contract with you. You pay weekly.

Same criteria as for normal models apply for price and results.

Web Cam models can be hired by dating someone, asking a contact or 
sometimes apply for a job themselves. 

Web cam models are likely to also perform as video models.

Tag (Contact list): PEWebCam


CAM OPERATOR
------------

The higher the porn fame of the cam op is, the better the footage will be.
If you hire a cam op with high porn fame you will have to pay a high salary.

You can also hire a newbie and send him/her to trainings to get better.
This will NOT result in increasing salary but in better footage.

A cam op gets better over time. Also they will get aroused during their work 
and like to join after shootings...

A cam operator is required to do shootings with you being one of the actors.

Tag (Contact list): PECamOperator

SCENE ASSISTANT
---------------

The scene assistant is in duty to do the make up, clean up the scene and care 
for all other people at the set.

The higher the porn fame of the assistant is, the better the performance will be.
If you hire an assistant with high porn fame you will have to pay a high salary.

You can also hire a newbie and send him/her to trainings to get better.
This will NOT result in increasing salary but in better footage.

Tag (Contact list): PESceneAssistant


WEB ADMIN
---------

A web admin automatically uploads new footage. The better his/her intelligence is, 
the better his work will be. (Web admins do some magic to increase the value of the 
uploaded stuff. Don't ask - they are nerds and therefore know what other nerds need 
to be attracted... ;-))

If you hire a admin with high intelligence you will have to pay a high salary.

You can also hire a newbie and send him/her to trainings to get better.
This will NOT result in increasing salary but in better footage.

A web admin (if perverted or submissive enough) can be asked to become a model.

Tag (Contact list): PEAdmin


Known problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you DELETE a model from your contact list (blocking is OK) you will 
loose all shootings associated to it. This is currently not fixable.

You cannot hire relatives as employees (cam operator, scene assistant, web admin).
